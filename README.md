Pomotomo: a Pomodoro site
The site is a timer that had configurable "work" "short break" and "long break" segments.
You can also add tasks to a task list and check them off.

I chose to include the work, short, and long segments, a settings page, start/stop, and a task list as I thought that were the minumum features.
In terms of the features, there are components, mobile responsiveness.
I spent 6 hours developing, 7 if you include design.

Things I would add if there were no time contrainsts:
ability to delete tasks.
color change when switching segments.
animations when completing a segment.
align components and make it prettier.
create styled checkboxes.
login and accounts to be able track stats and remember settings.
the app remembers tasks on refresh but not timer times, so i'll make it so it remembers settings
ability to move tasks around.
make timer say 00:00 instead of 0:0.
add a blurb to explain the pomodoro method.
